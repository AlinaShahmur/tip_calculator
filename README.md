# Tip Calculator
---
## The application for calculating the sum of tip that we can leave in restaurant/cafe based on check amount.

The main purpose of the application is to automatize the process of making-decision what sum of tip we need to leave in restaurant/cafe.

## Technology Stack:
---
- HTML
- CSS
- SCSS
- JS
- React

In order to keep declarative and component approach in building this application I used React.
I used SCSS preprocessor due to allow use nested syntax that is very structured and readable.

## How to use

1. Enter the check amount in the input

2. Press on the button

3. And, vual√°, get the result!
